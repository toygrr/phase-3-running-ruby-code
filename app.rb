# #app.rb

puts "Hello World!"
print "Pass this test, please."
p [1, 2, 3]

# puts "Hello world!"  #equivalent to console.log - the first syntax is preferred
# puts("Hello world!")

# # run code in terminal by using "ruby <filename>"
# # puts will automatically add a line break between strings, whereas print will not.

# print "Hello world!"
# print "Hello world!"
# print "Hello world!"

# # puts isnt ideal for displaying every data type into the console..
# # in this case, each value will be displayed on its own line. (calls .to_s method, coercing it into a string)
# puts [1, 2, 3]

# # the p method will return the whole array on less lines (calls the inspect method)
# p [1, 2, 3]

# # pp 'pretty printing' will display the information in the console but colorized and pretty, for more complex data types
# pp [{ id: 1, hello: "World" }, { id: 2, hello: "Ruby" }, { id: 3, hello: "Moon" }, { id: 4, hello: "Learner" }]

# # all methods in ruby have a return value
# # the puts method always returns nil (null in JS)
# #always use snake_case when writing seperate variable words.
